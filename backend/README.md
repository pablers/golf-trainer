# Golf Master Trainer - Backend

This is the backend for the Golf Master Trainer application. It is a Node.js server built with Express, TypeScript, and Prisma.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't already, clone the main repository to your local machine.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the Database

The backend uses PostgreSQL for the database.

**a. Create a PostgreSQL database**

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL server running. Create a new database for this project. For example, you can call it `golf_master_trainer`.

**b. Configure the Database URL**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory by copying the `.env.example` file (if it exists) or by creating a new one. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual database credentials:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>"
```

For example:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/golf_master_trainer"
```

**c. Run Database Migrations**

Once you have configured the database URL, you need to run the database migrations to create the tables:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This command will create the database tables based on the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

**d. Seed the Database (Optional)**

You can seed the database with some initial data by running the following command:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

This will run the `prisma/seed.ts` script, which creates a sample user and a golf course.

### 4. Running the Server

To start the backend server in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/courses`: Get all golf courses.
- `GET /api/scorecards?userId=<userId>`: Get all scorecards for a user.
- `GET /api/scorecards/:id`: Get a single scorecard by its ID.
- `POST /api/scorecards`: Create a new scorecard.
